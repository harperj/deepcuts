Much like authors and editors of written language, cinematographers and film editors have their own unique style.

Our goal is to better understand the use of cinematographic techniques in defining a motion pictureâ€™s visual style. What types of shots are most common? Are certain shots arranged in predictable ways across many motion-pictures?
