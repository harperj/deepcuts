\section*{Background \& Significance}
Significant work has been done in the area of cinematography analysis \cite{bresson_notes_1997}, \cite{bordwell_film_2009}, \& \cite{arijon_grammar_1991}; however, this work has been primarily done manually by cinema experts. Some computational approaches to film synthesis and editing have been proposed, such as \cite{he_virtual_1996} \& \cite{lino_how_2014}, but these have relied upon rules defined in cinematography textbooks and have not drawn on actual film data. Our work is the first data driven cinematograhy analysis system that is grounded in both how movies are made and the data from the movies themselves.
