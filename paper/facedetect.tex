\section*{Composition and Face Detection}

We analyze film composition at two levels of abstraction: the \emph{frame} and the \emph{sequence}.  A frame is a single image produced by a camera in the film.  A sequence is a series of camera shots, where each shot is an unbroken series of frames produced by a single camera.  Frame composition and sequence structure provide a sufficient basis upon which to begin analysis, are explicitly defined, and are directly related to the work of the cinematographer.

To analyze frame composition and sequence structure we first classify each frame and then use patterns in the sequence of frame classes to determine sequential structure.
