\section*{Composition and Face Detection}

We analyze film composition at two levels of abstraction: the \emph{frame} and the \emph{sequence}.  A frame is a single image produced by a camera in the film.  A sequence is a series of camera shots, where each shot is an unbroken series of frames produced by a single camera.  Frame composition and sequence structure provide a sufficient basis upon which to begin analysis, are explicitly defined, and are directly related to the work of the cinematographer.

To analyze frame composition and sequence structure we first classify each frame and then use patterns in the sequence of frame classes to determine sequential structure.

\subsection*{Frame Composition}

We restrict our description of the frame composition to population, zoom and position of actors in the frame. Other visual elements, such as non-human points of interest (e.g. a car in the midst of a chase sequence) can be as or more important than actors in a given frame; however, actors are at the core of most motion-pictures, and are therefore a good point of entry for better automatic understanding frame composition. To detect the population, zoom and position of actors in each frame we use a state-of-the-art face detector~\cite{mathias_face_2014}.

The population of a frame is defined as the number of faces visible. We consider a face to be valid whether it is an actor, a photograph, a movie-within-a-movie or some other indirect face. A face is also valid regardless of minor occlusions (e.g. hair or partial masks) and orientation (e.g. face is oriented away from the camera). A face is invalid if it is non-human (e.g. animals, monsters, drawings, or CGI renderings). 

Zoom is the perceived distance between camera and actor. This is typically classified by how much of the actor is visible within the shot. Figure \ref{fig:zoomClass} shows the seven commonly used zoom classifications. We stick to the traditional nomenclature of 'shot', though we are classifying frames. The classifications  are, in descending order of 'closeness':


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Extreme Close-Up - ECU} The camera is so close to the actor that the actor's face exceeds the size of the frame.

\textbf{Close-Up - CU} The viewer can see the actor's entire face, but the shoulders are typically not in the frame. 

\textbf{Medium Close-Up - MCU} These frames contain the actor's entire face as well as their neck, shoulders, and clavicular region. 

\textbf{Medium Shot - MS} These frames show the actor from the abdomen and above. 

\textbf{Medium Long Shot - MLS} These frames contain most, but not all of an actor's body. The shots typically contain some or all of the leg, but will not show the feet. %A common location to cut-off the actor in these shots is at the knees. Cutting at mid-thigh, the knees, or mid-shin is considered more visually appealing than cutting at the ankles \cite{arijon_grammar_1991}.

\textbf{Long Shot - LS} The actor's entire body, from head to toe, is visible. In these frames, the actor is generally still in the forefront of the frame. 

\textbf{Extreme Long Shot - ELS} In these shots, the actor is visible, but at a significant distance from the camera. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We assume that the proportion between the height of an actor's head and the height of their body is relatively consistent across actors. We define the 7 types of zoom by the ratio of the face height, $f$, to the frame height, $h$. By taking measurements of pre-classified frames, we computed the following $f$:$h$ ratios for each class of zoom:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ l | l l}
    Shot Name & Abbrv. & Range \\ \hline
    Extreme Close-Up & ECU & $f > h$ \\ 
    Close-Up & CU & $h \geq f > 0.6h$ \\ 
    Medium Close-Up & MCU & $0.6h \geq f > 0.3h$ \\ 
    Medium Shot & MS & $0.3h \geq f > 0.2h$ \\ 
    Medium Long Shot & MLS & $0.2h \geq f > 0.1h$ \\ 
    Long Shot & LS & $0.1h \geq f > 0.02h$ \\ 
    Extreme Long Shot & ELS & $0.02h \geq f$
    \label{tab:zoomTypes}
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These ratios are applied to the bounding boxes produced by face detectors. The height of the bounding box our $f$ and the vertical resolution of the frame our $h$. Note that in the case of frames with population $> 1$, we tag the frame based on the face closest to the camera. 

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{Positioning}
Frame composition is also defined by the position of faces in the frame. Texts on cinematography frequently divide a frame horizontally into 2, 3, or 4 parts and vertically into 2 or 3 parts. We divide the frame into a $3\times 3$ grid. The vertical classifications are top, middle, \& bottom. The horizontal classifications are left, center, \& right. These classifications are considered in isolation or combinatorially to create, for example, top-right and middle-center. This classification has the advantage of clear perceptual salience. While it is difficult to discern whether a face is in the left quarter of a frame compared to the left third of a frame, it is much easier to determine whether it is centered, in the left third, or in the right third. Edge cases, such as frames composed using the `rule of thirds', are difficult for a human to classify; however, the $3\times 3$ grid offers a good compromise between precision and visual salience. A frame is given a tag corresponding to the grid cell containing the centroid of the largest face in the frame. Figure \ref{fig:gridLabels} shows the tags. %--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    {fig/dyGrid.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{The size of the dynamic grid is based on the size of the face relative to the size of the frame.}
\label{fig:dyGrid}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The Dynamic Grid}
We use a dynamic grid that  reduces the size of the middle and center sections such that their dimensions are equal to 1/3 of the space in which the facial centroid could occur, see Figure \ref{fig:dyGrid}. The size of the dynamic grid is computed as follows: 
\begin{eqnarray}
  G_{w} &= I_{w} - f_{w} \\
  G_{h} &= I_{h} - f_{h}
\end{eqnarray}

Where $h$ and $w$ represent height and width, respectively, and $G$, $I$, \& $f$ represent Grid, Image, and face. This avoids middle-center convergence, a phenomena where the centroid of large faces converge to the middle-center grid-cell. The dynamic grid  maintains the visual salience of slight position variations (Figure \ref{fig:leftRight}) by preventing middle-center convergence in a principled manner.

\label{fig:2talk}
\end{figure*}

\subsection*{The Sequence}
We define a sequence as a series of frames of arbitrary length. Scenes are then a subset of sequences that fit within the single idea constraint. Defining a sequence as a series of frames with or without scene continuity allows us to search for patterns of frames that are frequently used to construct sequences. One example of this kind of pattern is that used in a 2-actor dialogue. One common construction of a scene in which two actors converse is to place one actor in the right side of the frame and the other actor in the left side of the frame. The frames alternate from showing one actors face to the other, but the relative positioning remains the same, as in Figure \ref{fig:2talk}. \cite{arijon_grammar_1991} defines many possible shot sequences. We use our frame level classifications to convert the problem of sequence pattern discovery and location into an N-Gram analysis problem.

%\label{fig:tagExample1}
%\end{figure}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Identifying \& Locating Patterns}
Understanding the visual impact of these sequence structures is best illustrated by the idea of the two person dialogue or '2-talk'. When filming these kinds of sequences, the cinematographer defines the line of interest as the line between the eyes of the two actors, see Figure \ref{fig:lineOfInterest}. The cinematographer places all of the cameras to one side of this line of interest. This significantly reduces the possibility that cameras will appear in each other's image planes. More relevant to our work, it maintains position consistency of the two actors from frame to frame, see Figure \ref{fig:2talk}. 

The 2-talk and other scene and sequence patterns are a key element in cinematographic style. The patterns defined in \cite{arijon_grammar_1991} and other cinematographic textbooks are often what differentiates a professionally filmed motion-picture from what one might see on YouTube. In the frame classification step, we tagged each frame based on its population, zoom, and position. With these tags, we convert a frame into a string as shown in Figure \ref{fig:2talk}. We then define a motion-picture as a string with many such frames. This reduces the problem of visual pattern finding to one of N-Gram analysis.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]
    {fig/lineOfAction.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{By placing all cameras on one side of the invisible 'line of interest' for an entire scene, the relative positioning of actors will remain consistent from shot to shot.}
\label{fig:lineOfInterest}
\end{figure}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{N-Gram Analysis}

We reduce our visual pattern finding problem into one of text analysis and use simple N-Gram algorithms to find visual patterns. The primary algorithm we use is most frequent substring. Having defined each movie in a dataset as a string of frame-tags, we pass the set of strings into the algorithm. We also define a minimum length, a maximum length, and a minumum or maximum number of repetitions. The system outputs a list of all patterns that meet our length and repetition critera and their frequency within the dataset. If we have a known pattern, whether selected from a cinematography text or found through our pattern discovery tool, we use simple text-search tools to find which movies contain that pattern and where the pattern occurs. Figures \ref{fig:pat1} shows still-frame examples of a single pattern found in multiple movies.

\subsubsection*{Face Detection}
Our current system uses the HeadHunter \cite{mathias_face_2014} detection model as formulated for the Deformable Parts Model \cite{lsvm-pami}. While not quite reaching the performance of the current state-of-the-art, this detector is available off the shelf and can be run on remote clusters with little setup cost. As better face detectors become available, we will incorporate them into our framework.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
