\section*{Shot Detection}

Short summary of why we did shot detection (transition from face detection) goes here.

\subsubsection*{Random Forests}

Briefly describe random forests method and show the results.

\subsubsection*{CNN}

Briefly describe CNN method and show the results.

We designed a Convolutional Neural Network for use with shot boundary detection. We computed pairwise differences in luminance; vertical \& horizontal optical flow; \& the red, green, \& blue color channels for every pair of adjacent frames in a video. These differences were passed as as $6 \times h \times w$ matrix where $h = height$ \& $w = width$ of the frames. These arrays were then non-uniformly scaled to $256 \times 256$ pixels to ensure consistency across videos with different aspect ratios. 

Once the $N \times 6 \times 256 \times 256$ arrays had been constructed, they were passed into a 7 layer network, with a network architecture heavily inspired by LeNet \cite{lecun1998gradient}.

Due to time, data, and implementation limitations, we were unable to obtain results from using our architecture, however we plan to continue this work in future research.
